# Portfolio-website
I've designed my portfolio website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've prioritized a user-friendly experience for individuals browsing on both mobile and desktop devices. By incorporating Bootstrap into the development process, I've ensured that the website is responsive and adapts smoothly to various screen sizes. You can find my portfolio website up and running, hosted graciously on Netlify.
